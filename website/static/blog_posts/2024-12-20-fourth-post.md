# Automatic Leverage
Last season, the third week I used these projections, I took down the DraftKings $33 Three Point Stance (5-max) for $20,000 with Tua Tagovailoa double stacked with De'Von Achane and Jonnu Smith. Tua had just come back from a scary injury and the industry at large was hesitant to give him a high projection. 

The player props market told a different story and as a result my projection was 2 points clear of most others. Dolphins player ownership was not as high as it should have been and I reaped the rewards.
